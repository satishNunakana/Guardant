# This is a comment.
# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners.

# Order is important; the last matching pattern takes the most precedence.

# These owners will be the default owners for everything in
# the repo. Unless a later match takes precedence,
# @global-owner1 and @global-owner2 will be requested for
# review when someone opens a pull request.
